- Rust macros are good since they generally:
    - avoid unintended side-effects
    - do not result in bizarre error messages
    - are not simple text substitutions, they must be parseable
    - are subject to much more rigorous analysis during compilation
    - are an elegant way to add a lot of power to a program, with limited risk
    - are well thought out and tightly integrated into the ecosystem 
    - have few detractors within the Rust community
    - are actually a big selling point of the language
