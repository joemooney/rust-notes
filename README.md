# My Rust Notes

As part of writing my notes, I am storing them using gitbook-like clone *mdbook*. This repo serves the dual purpose of documenting my experience and documenting how I went about documenting.

## Goals

- create a wrapper crate for mdbook to create new books.

This repo will have commands and instructions for creating a new empty book.

## Install

- GitHub source code for book: [https://github.com/joemooney/rust-notes/](https://github.com/joemooney/rust-notes/)
- View the published book:  [https://joemooney.github.io/rust-notes/](https://joemooney.github.io/rust-notes/)
- Build/View the book locally: ```mdbook build --open```
- Rebuild/View loop: ```mdbook watch --open```

Once you have opened the book the rest of the instructions for setting up a new book, editing, publishing etc. are within the book itself.
