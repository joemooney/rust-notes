# Cargo

- To upgrade all your your existing crates you have installed run ```cargo install-update -a```

Say you have an existing directory, an empty git repo.
To turn this into a Rust project you run ```cargo init . --bin```
If you then execute ```cargo run``` it will compile and run it, printing out **Hello World!***
