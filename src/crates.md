# Crates

Crates are libraries or binaries that are typically stored in [crates.io](http://crates.io)

Here are some crates that are awesome:

- [anymap](https://crates.io/crates/anymap)
- [anymap](crates/anymap.md)

There are so many great crates and the running cargo install is a breeze (although it can take some time depending on the dependencies).

- cargo install [mdbook-mermaid](https://github.com/badboy/mdbook-mermaid)
  - cool flowcharts and other graphs for your book
